sock.lua is a networking library for LÖVE games. Its goal is to make getting started with networking as easy as possible.

[Documentation](https://camchenry.github.io/sock.lua/)

**sock requires [enet](https://github.com/leafo/lua-enet) (which comes with LÖVE 0.9 and up.)**

## Features

- Event trigger system makes it easy to add behavior to network events.
- Can send images and files over the network.
- Can use a custom serialization library.
- Logs events, errors, and warnings that occur.

# Installation

1. Clone or download sock.lua.
2. Clone or download [bitser](https://github.com/gvx/bitser).\*
3. Place bitser.lua in the same directory as sock.lua.
4. Require the library and start using it. `sock = require 'sock'`

\* If custom serialization support is needed, look at [setSerialization](https://camchenry.github.io/sock.lua//index.html#Server:setSerialization).

# Example

```lua
local sock = require "sock"

-- client.lua
function love.load()
    -- Creating a new client on localhost:22122
    client = sock.newClient("localhost", 22122)
    
    -- Creating a client to connect to some ip address
    client = sock.newClient("198.51.100.0", 22122)

    -- Called when a connection is made to the server
    client:on("connect", function(data)
        print("Client connected to the server.")
    end)
    
    -- Called when the client disconnects from the server
    client:on("disconnect", function(data)
        print("Client disconnected from the server.")
    end)

    -- Custom callback, called whenever you send the event from the server
    client:on("hello", function(msg)
        print("The server replied: " .. msg)
    end)

    client:connect()
    
    --  You can send different types of data
    client:send("greeting", "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya.")
    client:send("isShooting", true)
    client:send("bulletsLeft", 1)
    client:send("position", {
        x = 465.3,
        y = 50,
    })
end

function love.update(dt)
    client:update()
end
```

```lua
-- server.lua
function love.load()
    -- Creating a server on any IP, port 22122
    server = sock.newServer("*", 22122)
    
    -- Called when someone connects to the server
    server:on("connect", function(data, client)
        -- Send a message back to the connected client
        local msg = "Hello from the server!"
        client:send("hello", msg)
    end)
end

function love.update(dt)
    server:update()
end
```
